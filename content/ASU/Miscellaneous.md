### Rectus Sheath Haematoma
	- Epidemiology
		- 
	- Risk Factors
		- Coughing
		- Trauma
	- Symptoms
	- Investigation
		- Blood tests (FBC, Chem20, Coags +/- G+H)
		- CT Angio
	- Management
		- Conservative Management
			- Reverse the reversible risks (i.e. anticoagulation, cough, etc.)
		- Operative Management
			- Angioembolisation
			- Evacuation of the haematoma



### Necrotising Soft Tissue Infection (NSTI)
 - Myonecrosis
 - Necrotising Fasciitis
	  - Definition: Spreading necrosis in plane of subcutaneous fat and fascia
	  - Type I (Polymicrobial)
		  - Most <span style="color:#00b050">common type (75%)</span> which often occurs in comorbid patients, typically without a traumatic entry point
		  - Gram Positive Organisms
			  - Group A Streptococcus
		  - Gram Negative Organisms
			  - E. Coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella
		  - Anaerobic Organisms
			  - Bacteroides, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus
	 - Type II (Monomicrobial)
		- Occurs in younger, less comorbid patients (25%) and is typically associated with trauma or an entry point
		- Organisms:
			- Group A Strep, MRSA, Clostridium Perfringens
	- Type III (Water type)
		- Occurs in warm water regions
		- Organisms:
			- Aeromons Hydrophilia (fresh water)
			- Vibrio spp (saltwater)
	- Type IV (Fungal)
		- Occurs in immunocompromised patients
		 - Organisms:
			 - Candida




### Mesenteric Scleritis (Sclerosing mesenteritis)
 - Chronic inflammatory condition of the mesentery which describes three distinct histological entities;
	 - Mesenteric panniculitis,
	 - Retractile mesenteritis, 
	 - Mesenteric lipodystrophy
- Assessment and History
	- Aetiology
		- Aetiology is uncertain, but the disease has been associated with trauma, autoimmune disease, surgery, and malignancy.
		- Mean age of diagnosis 55 $\pm$ 19.2 years ^[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28197781/| A systematic review of 192 cases]
	- Risk Factors
	- Diagnosis
		- Sclerosing mesenteritis can be visualized on abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI
		- The Coulier criteria can be used to diagnose sclerosing mesenteritis on CT:
			- 1. Presence of well-defined mass effect on neighbouring structures 
			- 2. Constituted by mesenteric fat tissue of inhomogeneous higher attenuation than adjacent retroperitoneal or meso-colonic fat 
			- 3. containing small soft tissue nodes 
			- 4. May typically be surrounded by a hypo-attenuated [[Miscellaneous#^380d09|'fatty halo/ring sign]] 
				- Considered inconsistent but very specific
			- 5. Hyperattenuating pseudocapsule may also surround the entire entity 
				- Considered inconsistent but very specific
- Pathophysiology
- Investigations
	- CT Abdo/Pelvis
		- 'Misty mesentery' is an increase in mesenteric attenuation with the presence of small nodes and the absence of a discrete soft-tissue mass 
		- 'Fat ring sign' ^[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14615565/| CT Findings in sclerosing mesenteritis] is the preservation of fat around the mesenteric vessels and around soft tissue nodules on the background of diffuse fat stranding  ^380d09
			- ![[CT Fat ring sign.png]]
		- 'Pseudo-capsule'
- Management
	- Exclude malignancy
	- ?Steroids
