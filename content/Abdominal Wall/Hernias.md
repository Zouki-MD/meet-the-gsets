hernias. World J Surg 13:545â€“554, 1989.]
	- **Definition**: Posterior rectus sheath incision with retromuscular extraperitoneal mesh placement.
	- In the modified Rives-Stoppa technique, the posterior rectus sheath is incised approximately 0.5 cm from the fascial edge of the defect. The retromuscular plane is then developed to the lateral extent of the dissection: the <span style="color:#00b050">linea semilunaris</span>. If this dissection is insufficient to close the posterior rectus fascia, an extension of this technique is the [[Transversus Abdominis Release]] repair. ^[Sabiston's 20th Ed, Chapter 17]
	
- [[Transversus Abdominis Release]]
	- In this technique, the transversus abdominis muscle is divided, which then permits entrance into the space between the transversalis fascia and the lateral edge of this divided transversus abdominis muscle. 
	- This allows the creation of a wide lateral dissection plane with substantial posterior and anterior fascial advancement. 
	- Both procedures avoid a major subcutaneous dissection and preserve the neurovascular bundle
