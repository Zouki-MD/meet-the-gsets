### Histology
- In the esophageal [mucosa](https://histology.siu.edu/erg/giguide.htm#mucosa) --

> Esophageal epithelium is [non-keratinized stratified squamous](https://histology.siu.edu/intro/epith.htm#stratsquam).  Note that the basal surface of the epithelium is deeply indented by connective tissue papillae.  
> 
> > In oblique section through the epithelium, the connective tissue papillae can look like "islands", apparently surrounded by epithelium.  Beginning students frequently mistake such an appearance for glands.

> 
> Esophageal [muscularis mucosa](https://histology.siu.edu/erg/giguide.htm#muscmucosa) is noticably thicker than that in the stomach and intestine, and includes only longitudinal muscle fibers.  
> 
> > Because the longitudinal fibers occur in bundles, a longitudinal section passing between bundles may not include any evidence of muscularis mucosae.

Connective tissue of the [submucosa](https://histology.siu.edu/erg/giguide.htm#submucosa) is typically more fibrous and less cellular than that the lamina propria of the mucosa.  Esophageal submucosa includes scattered [esophageal glands](https://histology.siu.edu/erg/esoph.htm#glands) (not included in this micrograph, see [this image](https://histology.siu.edu/erg/GI060b.htm)) and a [venous plexus](https://histology.siu.edu/erg/esoph.htm#venousplexus) (not conspicuous in this micrograph).

[Muscularis externa](https://histology.siu.edu/erg/giguide.htm#muscularis) of the esophagus consists of the standard inner circular and outer longitudinal layers of smooth muscle, with Auerbach's plexus in between.  Only the circular muscle is included in this micrograph.

### Notes
- The lower third of the oesophagus in the posterior mediastinum drains downwards by oesophageal veins, through the oesophageal opening in the diaphragm, to the left gastric vein. The oesophagus above this level drains into the azygos system of veins.
- Here is a watershed from which venous blood is diverted into the systemic system and the portal system. 
- In portal obstruction from any cause the oesophageal tributaries of the left gastric vein become distended beneath the mucous membrane of the lower oesophagus. Such oesophageal varices may rupture and give rise to massive haemorrhage. 
- The left gastric vein runs to the left along the lesser curvature up to the oesophagus, then passes around behind the peritoneum of the posterior wall of the lesser sac, with the left gastric artery. It passes down to the right above the hepatic artery and joins the portal vein at the upper border of the pancreas

 




- **Arterial blood supply:** upper thoracic - abdominal - left gastric and inferior phrenic arteries; infarction is rare due to numerous anastomoses
- **Venous drainage:** extensive submucosal venous plexus communicates with periesophageal veins; flows into inferior thyroid (upper 1/3), azygous (middle 1/3) and gastric veins (lower 1/3); azygous vein empties into superior vena cava and gastric veins into portal system; this connection between caval and portal venous systems explains esophageal varices due to portal hypertension
- **Nerves:** left and right vagus nerves run lateral to esophagus, form plexi along anterior and posterior surfaces, then reunite to form anterior and posterior vagal trunks to stomach; have parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation
- **Lymphatic drainage:** freely anastomosing networks in submucosa, muscularis propria and occasionally lamina propria; facilitate lengthwise tumor dissemination; upper third drains into paratracheal and internal jugular nodes, middle third to mediastinal nodes, lower third to nodes around aorta and celiac axis
- **Adjacent structures:** cervical esophagus lies in posterior mediastinum, posterior to trachea and thyroid gland; is bounded by left and right recurrent laryngeal nerves and carotid sheaths; distal esophagus is posterior to left atrium and bounded by azygous veins; passes through opening in diaphragm called the hiatus
- **Incisura / angle of His:** left side of esophagus forms sharp angle where it joins the stomach
