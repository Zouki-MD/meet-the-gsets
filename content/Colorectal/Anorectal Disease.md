## The Rectum
### Anatomy
 - Gross Anatomy
	- The Rectum is about 12-15 cm long and defined as the section between the sacral promontory to the Levator Ani muscles at the point where the taenia colic coalesce into a continuous layer
	- Contains 3 lateral curves and folds (Valve of Houston)
		- Superior portion curves to the right with a Left valve of Houston
		- Middle portion curves to the left with a Right valve of Houston
		- Inferior portion curves to the right with a Right vale of Houston
	- Peritoneal reflections
		- Proximal 1/3rd is covered anterior and laterally
	- Levator Ani muscle (Puborectalis, Pubococcygeus, Iliococcygeus) ^19b7fe
		- Origin: Body of pubis, tendinous arch of obturator fascia and ischial spine
		- Insertion: Perineal body, coccyx, anococcygeal raphe, walls of prostate gland or vagina, rectum, anal canal
			![[CLR. Pelvic floor muscles.png]]
		- Innervation: Anterior rami of lower sacral nerves, perineal nerve
		- Blood supply: Inferior gluteal artery, internal pudendal artery and its branches (inferior rectal and perineal arteries)

### Embryology
## The Anus
### Anatomy
 - The Anal Canal
	 - The last 4 cm of the GI tract at the junction of the pelvic floor which contains an internal sphincter (visceral) and external sphincter (**skeletal**)

-   The upper half is lined by simple columnar mucosa (which is plum red due to the internal rectal venous plexus)

-   The lower half is lined by stratified squamous non-keratinizing epithelium.

·       In this lower part there are 6 to 10 anal columns, which are vertical folds. Each column contains a terminal branch of the superior rectal artery and vein, these being largest at the 4, 7 and 11 o’clock positions

-   Enlargements of the terminal parts of the venous channels and their anastomoses with each other gives rise to internal hemorrhoids. **Internal haemorrhoids can not be palpated**

·       The lower ends of the anal columns are joined together by folds of mucus membrane called the anal valves, above each of which is a space called the anal sinus

·       The anal valves together are known as the pectinate line, which is situated opposite the internal anal sphincter

- Anal Sphincters
	- ![[CLR. Anal Sphincter Anatomy.png]]

-   Tears of the anal valves give rise to anal fissures.

·       The anal canal extends below the pectinate line as the pecten or transitional part, which is said to be bluish in color. The pecten ends inferiorly at the 'white line' of Hilton, which is actually bluish pink and is rarely visible in the living.

·       Internal anal sphincter

-   Involuntary smooth muscle thickening of the inner circular muscle coat of the rectum (5mm to 8mm) surrounding the anorectal junction and upper 2/3rds and ends at the white line

-   It is under the control of parasympathetics from S2, S3, S4 segments of the spinal cord (“S2, 3, 4, keeps your ass off the floor”)

·       External anal sphincter

-   Circular muscle which **attaches posteriorly to the coccyx** (only bony attachment) and blends with the puborectalis part of levator ani (except anteriorly in the midline where it attaches to the perineal body)

-   The subcutaneous part of the muscle loops inwards (‘J’ shaped from side-on view) to lie below the lower part of the internal sphincter

·       External anal sphincter consists of three parts from inferior to superior:

-   Subcutaneous (circular muscle which surrounds the lowest part of the anal canal and lies below the level of the internal anal sphincter),

-   Superficial (oblong shaped portion surrounding the internal sphincter which is attached to the perineal body anteriorly and to the anococcygeal raphe posteriorly)

-   Deep (circular fibres which surround the internal sphincter and blend superiorly with the fibres of the levator ani)





-   Defined as the region between the levator ani and the anal verge

-   Anal canal is about 2.5 – 5 cm long and is longer in men

-   Columns of Morgagni

·       Mucosal folds above the dentate line

·       Opening of the anal crypts are located here

-   Anal sphincter complex

·       Internal anal sphincter

o   5mm thickened extension of the smooth, inner circular muscle of the rectum

o   Parasympathetic innervation of smooth muscle via pelvic splanchnic nerves contributes 70 – 80% of resting sphincter tone

·       External anal sphincter

o   Continuation of the pubo-rectalis muscle which blends with the longitudinal muscle fibres of the bowel wall

o   Attached to the tip of the coccyx and perineal body via the anococcygeal ligament

o   Skeletal muscle innervated by branches from the pudendal nerve

-   Nerve supply

·       Pudendal nerve

o   Voluntary control of defecation by acting on the external anal sphincter

o   Sensation and recto-anal reflex

-   Lymph drainage

·       Upper aspect of rectum

o   Internal iliac nodes

·       Inferior aspect of rectum

o   Superficial inguinal group

### Anal Abscess and Fistula
 - Epidemiology
	 - There is a male predominance, most series reporting a male to female ratio between 2:1 and 4:1
	 - Anal fistulas most commonly afflict people in their 20 -50's
 - Initial Assessment
	 - History
		 - Regular bowel habit
			 - A patient who passes a hard stool twice a week will tolerate a greater degree of sphincter disturbance than another who opens their bowel three times a day to a loose
		 - Risk of incontinence and/or constipation
		 - Known malignancy or IBD
	- Risk Factors
	- Examination
		1. Location of the internal and external openings
			- The greater the distance of the EO the greater the likelihood of a complex cephalad extension of the tract
			- Irrigation of the EO with  dilute hydrogen peroxide is the easiest way of locating the internal opening
		1. Course of the primary track and the presence of extensions;
			- Asking the patient to contract the anal sphincters allows assessment of the position of the primary track in relation to the [[Anorectal Disease#^19b7fe|puborectalis sling]] (posteriorly) or upper border of the external anal sphincter (anteriorly)
			- Persistence of granulation tissue after curettage during the operation is an indication of a secondary extension
		2. Presence of other diseases complicating the fistula.

	- Goodsall's Rule
		- The IO of a fistula tract can be predicted based on the EO location and distance from the anal verge;
		- Anterior tracts (between 9 o'C and 3 o'C) have a radial insertion if the EO is within 3 cm from the AV
			- If the EO is further than 3 cm this is likely to insert posteriorly in the midline at 6 o'C (due to the higher chance of it being an anterior extension of a horse-shoe abscess)
			- The 'Midline Rule' suggests higher accuracy of locating IO for anterior tracts if assessing for an IO at 12 o'C as opposed to radial insertion (particularly in females) ^[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32107684/| Cirocco WC, Reilly JC. It is time to retire Goodsall's Rule: the Midline Rule is a more accurate predictor of the true and natural course of anal fistulas. Tech Coloproctol. 2020]
		- Posterior tracts (between 3 o'C and 9 o'C) insert in a curved fashion with the IO at 6 o'C

- Investigations
- Management
	- Operative
		- Examination Under Anaesthetic (EUA)
			- Internal Openings (IO) are evident in only about one-third of cases
		- Incision and Drainage
			- 
		- Fistulotomy
			- Avoid fistula treatment in any form unless a chronic track in the context of recurrent abscess formation is found. This is due to the chance of fistula resolution without intervention and avoids exposing individuals who will not experience further issues with the risks associated with a fistulotomy
