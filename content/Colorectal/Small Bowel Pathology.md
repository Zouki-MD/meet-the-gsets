## Small Bowel Obstruction
### Small Bowel Obstruction
 - Differentials
	 - Physiological (Ileus): A failure in peristalsis causing a functional obstruction without a mechanical narrowing
		 - Ddx: Recent abdominal operations, electrolyte disturbance, trauma, peritonitis, systemic infections, bowel ischaemia and medications.
	 - Extraluminal
		 - Hernias
		 - Adhesions
		 - Volvulus
		 - Abscess/endometriosis/peritoneal carcinomatosis
		 - SMA Syndrome
	 - Transmural
		 - Haematoma
		 - Intussusception
		 - Neoplasms (adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine tumours, lymphoma, sarcoma, metastasis)
			  ![[Small Bowel Neoplasms - Aetiology.png|600]]
		 - Strictures (inflammatory, ischaemic, anastomotic)
		 - IBD
	 - Intraluminal
		 - Foreign body (bezoar, gallstone ileus)
- Management
	- Hypochloraemic Hypokalaemic Metabolic **Alkalosis** and paradoxical aciduria
	- Vomiting causes a loss of H$^+$ ions and Cl$^-$ which leads to hypochloraemic hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis. Protracted vomiting causes a deficit of extracellular fluid volume leading to the urinary excretion of K$^+$ and H$^+$ to preserve Na$^+$ and water, so initial alkalotic urine becomes acidotic
