## Liver Lesions
 - Currently, most liver masses are asymptomatic and are identified incidentally during survey for chronic liver diseases or other purposes.
	 - Many liver masses occur in cirrhotic livers secondary to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections.
- Investigations
	- Imaging: 
		- USS, 
		- Dynamic CT (recommended) 
	- Bloods: 
		- BBV (Hep B, Hep C, HIV)
		- Tumour markers: Î±FP, CEA, Ca 19.9
	- Tissue:
		- Liver biopsy is only recommended when operative intervention is not planned and a correct diagnosis would alter treatment planning.

#### Adenomas
 - According to the original 2006 Bordeaux classification, there are four subtypes of hepatic adenomas
	 - Inflammatory
		 - Most common subtype
		 - Highest rate of bleeding
	- HNF1 alpha mutated
		- Second most common subtype
		- Only occur in women, typically on the ocp
		- Often multiple
	- Beta catenin mutated
		- Least common subtype
		- Higher risk in men on anabolic steroids and patients with glycogen storage disease or familial adenomatous polyposis
		- Typically represent cancer and therefore need to be cut out (hence excise all adenomas in men)
	- Unclassified
	- Sonic hedgehog-activated hepatocellular adenoma (sh-HCA)
		- New subtype
- Management
	- Excision is indicated in all surgically appropriate patients with a lesion
		- > 5 cm in female
		- in males
		- Symptomatic

## Operations
### Hepatectomy
 - Anatomy
	 - Phrenic veins are a macroscopic landmark for the hepatic veins
