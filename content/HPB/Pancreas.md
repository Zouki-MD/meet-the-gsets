	- Pancreatic divisum
		- High pressures causing delayed emptying
		- Justin chan says 11% of people have divisum and 1% have pancreatitis. More likely to be due to an alternative source

## Pancreatic Lesions
 - Investigations
 - Differentials
	 - Cystic
		 - Simple cyst
		 - Pseudocyst
		 - Cystic Neoplasms
			 - IPMN
			 - Serous Cystadenoma
			 - Mucinous Cystic Neoplasm
			- NET with cystic degeneration

	 - Solid 
		 - Solid Pseudopapillary Neoplasm (SPENs)
			 - Rare, low-grade malignant tumours that often affect young women
		- NET
		- Pancreatic adenocarcinoma
		- Metastatic Disease to the pancreas
			- <span style="color:#ff0000">Renal cell carcinoma</span>
				- Can typically present many years after resection
				- Best seen on dedicated imaging PSMA-PET
				- Hyper-enhancing on arterial phase imaging of the pancreas
