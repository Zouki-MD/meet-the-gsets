### Surgical Audit
 - [0] Surgical audit is a fundamental part of surgical practice involving a <span style="color:#00b050">systematic, unbiased, critical analysis </span>of the quality of surgical care, reviewed by peers against recognised standards. The purpose of the audit is both educational and patient centred, with audits forming a foundational component of the RACS CPD program. Participation in audits has also been shown to improve patient care and outcomes. 

The components of an effective audit include (PICO-P);
 1) P:Determining the scope %% fold %% 
	 - Reviewing the number of procedures, ensuring at a minimum 6 monthly reviews
	 - Reviewing available data and resource allocation
 2) I:Selecting standards %% fold %% 
	- Evidence-based research
	- Local guidelines
	- Participation in surgical groups like NSQIP (National Surgical Quality Improvement Program)
	- Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care Standards
 3) C:Collecting Data %% fold %% 
	 - Aiming to reduce the burden of collection by utilisation of previously existing electronic data
	 - Ensuring that the data is complete and accurately reflects the outcomes
 1) O: Peer reviewed presentation of the results
	 - Peer review should occur in a private setting, with no less than 3 surgeons and a designated chair role which rotates.
	 - The setting should allow minimal interruptions, with data projection facilities, a sufficient scheduling notice trying to reduce conflicts and aiming to be within work hours to reduce the burden of fatigue.
	 - An effective audit should be conducted in an educational, no-blame atmosphere of confidentiality and teamwork which promotes open discussion and self-reflection.  Confidentiality of the information used for and resulting from the audit is essential, for both patients and surgeons, and should be protected under the Health Insurance Act 1973. 
 1) P: Making changes and monitoring the progress
	 -  This should include both individual cases and examination of trends in practice over extended time periods

 - ***REVIEW BELOW***

 - Key aspects for an effective meeting should also be considered; %% fold %% 
	 - All surgeons should be members of an active peer review group of no fewer than three surgeons.
	 -  A conducive setting should be chosen considering privacy, coffee, minimal interruptions and data projection facilities.
	 - The role of Chair should rotate. It is most important to create equity and avoid bias, real or apparent. 
	 - An alternative is to appoint an independent chair such as a medical director or a recently retired surgeon.
	 - Meetings should be scheduled with sufficient notice to give relevant staff the opportunity to attend. 
	 - A record of attendance at peer review meetings should be kept to demonstrate satisfactory attendance.
	 - Peer review of an individual surgeon’s work should occur not less than six-monthly. For some units/departments a monthly audit may be sufficient, while for others less frequent review (for example, quarterly) may be appropriate. Comprehensive analysis benefits the identification of trends and better informs changes to be made
	 - Peer review should include both individual cases and examination of trends in practice over extended time periods. Outcome reviews can also include comparative assessments, focused reviews of specific problems or procedures, and follow up of recent changes.
	 -  The chair of the session should ensure all serious events are considered for appropriate review.
	 - Efforts should be made to identify quality issues (particularly system deficiencies) and appropriate actions to be taken. These issues should be brought to the attention of the hospital medical and administrative hierarchy and/or the specialty group executive.
	 - At the conclusion of the session, any plans or recommendations (if any) should be recorded and a person nominated to action. This may be a manager, hospital administrator, individual surgeon, resident or registrar.
	 - Importantly, all plans or recommendations should be followed up. The final outcomes column should be completed in a timely manner.
	 - Ideally, hospitals assist surgeons with the process of conducting an audit.

Types of audit %% fold %% 
 There are several types of audits defined by the scope of the review, including; 
 - **Total practice or workload audit:** covers all surgical operations performed
 - **Selected audit from surgical practice:** all patients who undergo a selected procedure, or all procedures within a selected time-frame
 - **Clinical unit audit:** clinical unit with a small number of individual surgeons participating
 - **Group or specialty audit:** e.g. under a group or specialty society, e.g. Australian vascular audit
 - **Focused audit:** collects data on the process or outcome indicators such as those recommended by departments of health which may influence it, e.g. what is the wound infection rate after large bowel surgery
 Audits are distinguished from;
	- Clinical reviews, which involve detailed presentations of one or more cases with specific objectives and are centred around a specific theme.
	- Research, which aims to extend the knowledge base of surgery

### Clinical Error
 - Adverse Event %% fold %% 
	 - An adverse event can be defined as <span style="color:#00b050">unintentional harm arising from an episode of healthcare and not due to the disease process itself</span>.
	 - Major adverse events, such as bile duct injury, anastomotic leakage, and unplanned re-operations should also be included and presented for peer review
 - Complication %% fold %% 
	  - A complication is any deviation from the normal post-operative course
	  - Some complications are adverse events, however it is the concept of 'unintentional harm' that differentiates between the two

- Sentinel Event  %% fold %%  ^135698
	- [0] Sentinel events are a subset of mandatorily reported adverse patient safety events that are wholly preventable and result in serious patient harm or death. They are infrequent and typically due to a systems issue and the reporting of these events to the Private Health Regulation Unit (PHRU) should occur within 2 days of identification in the process of open disclosure and risk management.
	- Sentinel events are a subset of adverse patient safety events that are wholly preventable and result in serious harm to, or death of, a patient
	- It is important to note that Sentinel Events occur infrequently and are often due to an issue with the way a system or process works in our health care system.
	 - From 2007, Sentinel Events have been reported by each Australian jurisdiction for inclusion in the Productivity Commission's _Report on Government Services (RoGS)._ The RoGS provides information on the effectiveness and efficiency of government services in Australia and contains annual data on the equity, efficiency, and cost effectiveness of government services.
	- Sentinel Events (4 surgical mistakes, Position, Prescription, Perfusion, Psychiatric, Physical, Paediatric)
		1. Surgery or other invasive procedure performed on the <span style="color:#00b050">wrong site</span> resulting in serious harm or death 
		- An invasive procedure is defined as a medical procedure that enters the body, usually by cutting or puncturing the skin or by inserting a needle, tube, device or scope into the body

		8. Suspected suicide of a patient in an acute psychiatric unit or acute psychiatric ward
		9. Use of physical or mechanical restraint resulting in serious harm or death
		10. Discharge or release of an infant or child to an unauthorised person
		11. All other adverse patient safety events resulting in serious harm or death.
	 - [0] This is a sentinel event and needs to be reported. I would fill out a Riskman, present the case at audit and review my own time-out and consent process. I would notify my head of department, the EDMS and the hospital lawyers. 

### Open Disclosure %% fold %% 
 - [0] Adverse events can occur in surgery, typically due to insufficiencies in hospital environment/systems, breakdown in a surgical team or occasionally surgeon error. Open disclosure addresses the adverse event and also results in broader benefits through systems improvements, improved clinical communication and reflective learning, and for patients these discussion are as important as understanding the reasons behind what transpired. During these times, RACS recommends an open disclosure framework to assist healthcare teams to respond effectively with transparency and compassion to build trust between patients, surgeons and health services. 
 -  Once an adverse event has occurred, a healthcare team should
	 - [ ] Establish the relevant facts
	 - [x] Assess the event and the level of response required
	 - [ ] Notify the relevant hospital executive member to activate a support structure through a quality unit for the clinical team, patient and carers
	 - [ ] Identify who will lead and be involved in the open disclosure process
	 - [ ] Consider whether additional investigation or reporting is required in consultation with the hospital executive director involved
	 - [ ] Identify other support and needs (this should form part of the hospital-based support service)
	 - [ ] Ensure all appropriate staff are sufficiently informed to enable a consistent response to the patient
	 - [ ] Consider whether their Medical Defence Organisation should be informed
	 - [ ] (I,E,A,O,U). Once an adverse event has occurred, the team should **identify** the level of response required, **establish** the facts, **assemble** a support team through notification of the relevant hospital executive and consider whether **other** individuals need to be notified (head of unit, EDMS, lawyers, MDO). Finally, all staff should be unified to enable a consistent and informed response.        

	- [0] (I,E,A,O,U) The team should **identify** the issue and the need for an open disclosure meeting, **establish** the facts about the outcome and expected progression (understanding formal investigations happen separately), **assemble** a support team through notification of the relevant hospital executive (head of unit, EDMS, lawyers, MDO) and consider whether **other** individuals need to be notified (subspecialist teams, interperters). Finally, all staff should be unified to enable a consistent and informed response.                                                                                                                                                Key elements of an open disclosure meeting is that it should occur in a timely manner, lead by the most senior clinician involved in the patients care in a private location, with no interruptions or external pressures. (A,E,I,O,U) I would being by introducing all involved and using empathetic communication (active listening, good eye contact, inviting cultural supports, open body language, using lay terms).                                                                                                                                                                                                         The senior clinician should begin by (A,E,I,O,U) **apologising**/express regret for what has transpired and provide an **explanation**. Open disclosure is not a time to attribute or accept blame but should be a time to give explanation. **Informed consent** is a key component of pre-operative informed decision making and understanding the patients knowledge and expectations is also a key component of open disclosure. Providing an **opportunity** for patients, families and carers to ask questions and relate their experience is a crucial component. The final step is to explain to the patient how we are going to address their potential consequences (**undo**) and prevent this recurring (RiskMan, Audit, review of personal practice). This includes addressing hospital/environmental contributions, personal contributions and team factors. This should be contemporaneously documented in the patients notes 
 - The elements of open disclosure should include (AEIOU - Apology, Explanation, Invitation to questions, Opportunity to relate their experience, undo):
	 - [ ] An apology or expression of regret
	 - [ ] A factual explanation of what happened
	 - [ ] An opportunity to ask questions
	 - [ ] An opportunity for the patient, their family and carers to relate their experience
	 - [ ] A discussion of the potential consequences of the adverse event
	 - [ ] An explanation of the steps being taken to manage the adverse event and prevent recurrence.
 - Open disclosure is separate from any investigation and review process. Open disclosure processes should avoid:
	  - [ ] Speculation on the causes of an incident
	  - [ ] Assigning blame or implying legal liability to any individual, group or system
	  - [ ] pre-emptive speculation of the results of reviews and investigations





 
### Clinical Governance

### Informed Consent and Material Risk
 - Informed Consent
 - Material Risk
	 - The law has always recognised that a doctor has a duty to warn a patient of a material risk inherent in any proposed procedure or treatment. A risk will be considered material if, in the circumstances of the particular case, a reasonable person in the position of the patient, if warned of the risk, would be likely to attach significance to it, or if the medical doctor is, or should reasonably be, aware that the particular patient, if warned of the risk, would be likely to attach significance to it
