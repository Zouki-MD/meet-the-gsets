 6. Collaboration and teamwork
	 - [0] Surgeons work in many different teams throughout their day and throughout their career. Sometimes these are formalised teams, such as the structured surgical team or MDT, and sometimes these are impromptu, such as a trauma call or emergency operating list. In each of these teams, effective achievement of the goal is underpinned by a unified focus to understand the issues and promote shared decision making from all stakeholders. This includes -patient/myself/team/hospital/GP- and fostering an environment where patient safety measures are the teams responsibility. This is achieved by an appropriate exchange of information, seeking help and managing conflict when differences arrive.
 7. Professionalism
 8. **Leadership and management**
	 - Leadership is a vital characteristic of a good surgeon and is aimed at influencing the team in a positive and constructive way to achieve a common objective or goal 
	 - Leadership takes many forms and is not just limited to positional roles of leadership with surgeons working in a variety of multi-disciplinary teams on a daily basis. Good leaders are able to influence their team to achieve better patient outcomes and a lack of leadership poses a risk to patient care.  
	 - A characteristic of a good leader relies  upon their ability to tailor the need to the specific situation, however it universally encompasses the ability to inspire and support others, as well as set and maintain the team standards. 
	 - This is underpinned by effective communication
		 - This starts every day in the clinical handover. Professionally advocating for the wellbeing of the patient, ensuring all members of the team have a unified approach to management and all stakeholders feel appropriated supported and involved.
		 - This continues in leading by example on the ward round, practicing evidence based medicine and ensuring accountability for patient's progression and extends to the appropriate delegation of team jobs to the abilities of those involved.
		 - Great leadership is also needed in times of recourse, both receiving positive and constructive feedback to at regular intervals to align the team goals.
	- Leadership extends our role as a teacher, underpinned by our medical expertise and clinical judgement
		 - Good leadership understand the limitations of their team mates and are able to safely expand on these through informal bedside teach, formal education, mentoring and research opportunities.
	- Ultimately, a leader sets and maintains the standards of the team through their professionalism.
		- This means supporting our colleagues and standing up when we see bulling, discrimination or harassment.
		- It also reflects in our ability to support our colleagues if we notice they are fatigued, stressed or challenged.
		- Professional behaviours are set through introductions to new or unfamiliar members, following hospital protocol and maintaining the sterile field.
	- These are all ways I aim to be a good surgical leader, and to ensure I am meeting this requirement I aim to have regular reviews of my performance from all members of the team. I do this by remaining accountable, contactable and being aware of my influence and role in the team. 
 9. Scholarship and Teaching
	 - Research
 10. Cultural Competency and Safety
	 - Cultural diversity in the surgical profession strengthens collective cultural competence and fosters cultural safety for people from diverse backgrounds who in the past have been less visible in surgery. 
	- It increases and improves services to under-served populations and will help ensure that surgeons who are overseas trained, First Nations and other people of colour, feel part of the RACS community and able to contribute fully and safely.   
	- Cultural diversity improves the health workforce by enriching teams’ cognitive diversity. This supports better problem solving, decision making, innovation and bias and blind spot mitigation. It helps everyone reach their full potential.
	- The RACS *Reconciliation Action Plan* 
	- Summary
		-  Increasing diversity in surgery will strengthen the profession and over time, ensure it reflects the community it serves.
