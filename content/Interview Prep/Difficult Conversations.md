	 - RACS also recognises that <span style="color:#00b050">a diverse workforce positively contributes to surgical outcomes</span>, strengthening the profession and enriching it with different perspectives
	 - Substantial evidence links unacceptable workplace behaviours, including discrimination, bullying, sexual harassment and microaggression with <span style="color:#00b050">increased risks to patient safety</span> (which is everyone's responsibility)
	 - It is important to note that the intent of the behaviour is not relevant when considering whether it is unacceptable. What matters is the perception and experience of the person or people who witness or are targeted by the unacceptable behaviour.

- Bullying
	 - [I] SPIES (Seek information, Peer Support, Initiative, Escalate, Summarise)
	- [0]  Bullying is an unacceptable behaviour which poses a risk to both patient and staff safety through a recurring pattern of behaviour and this needs to be acutely and adequately addressed. Healthcare workers have a right to a workplace free from discrimination, bullying and harassment, and it is up to all of us to take appropriate actions to address this. Unacceptable behaviours affect the individual, perpetrator, surgical team and hospital reputation and should be dealt with early and in a professional and sensitive manner, respecting the privacy of all involved.
	- In this situation I would first want to ensure I've accessed support from my peer network  mentor, colleague or RACS.  
	 - I would use a graded approach, and first consider discussing the situation with the person involved in an informal, non-confrontational way to resolve the issue, explaining how the issue is affecting me;
		 - This is best done over a cup of coffee conversation, with supports like the 'Speak Up' app advising on the best ways to approach this.
		 - Ask <span style="color:#00b050">someone you trust to speak to the person who has demonstrated the unacceptable behaviour</span>, and see if there is an opportunity to find out what their perspective is.
			 - Sometimes the person demonstrating the unacceptable behaviour does not understand the impact of their behaviour, and this provides an opportunity for them to reflect and amend their behaviour.
		 - Initiatives
			- If this was unsuccessful and I felt the situation wasn't rectified, I would familiarise myself with the  organisation’s policies on discrimination, bullying and sexual harassment and
			- Contemporaneously document any events pertaining to this behaviour.
			- I would discuss this with my manager, direct supervisor or someone in a position of authority to understand my rights and options.
			- I could consider escalating to report the events or making a formal complaint to the relevant department in your organisation i.e. People and Culture,<span style="color:#00b050"> Human Resources</span> etc.
			 - External agencies include <span style="color:#00b050">RACS Expert Advisory Group</span>, the <span style="color:#00b050">Fair Work Commission</span> or the <span style="color:#00b050">Queensland Human Rights Commission</span>
	- The impact of this behaviour on the team should also be considered, and I would gauge how this impacts my peers performance, workload and fatigue. I would ensure that we aim to minimise any impact on patient care and consider optimising the roster to minimise disruptions. It is important this is dealt with in a sensitive manner respecting the confidentiality of my colleague.
	- I would ensure the department is informed of the appropriate expectations of professionalism in the workplace to reduce the chance of this continuing unaddressed in the future. 
	- In summary, this is an unacceptable behaviour which should be addressed as it affects patient safety, staff safety, team efficacy and departmental reputation.

 - RACS recognises that bullying is an ongoing challenge in surgery, with the 2015 EAG survey of RACS fellows/Trainees reporting around a 50% incidence of DBSH. Concerning there is a wealth of  established evidence linking unprofessional conduct with increases risks to patient safety and this must be addressed. The college has aimed to address this in a sustained and multi-faceted approach through the 2022 '*Building Respect and Improving Patient Safety action plan*', which includes three main pillars;
	 - Cultural Change and Leadership, 
	 - Surgical Education
	 - Accountability and Complaints management.

- Building Respect and Improving Patient Safety
	 1) Establishing an advisory board in 2015 for reporting on DBSH within surgery
	 2) Training/Education
		 - The College has implemented targeted training and compulsory training for applicants, trainees and fellows through courses like *Introduction to Operating with Respect*. 
		 - Other courses include the *Human Factors* course or *Recognising and responding to sexual harassment*
	 3)  Diversity
		 - Increasing diversity in surgery will strengthen the profession and over time, ensure it reflects the community it serves.
		 - The College has introduced a new competency of 'Cultural Competency and Cultural Safety'
		 - This is done through the *Diversity Plan for RACS*, establishing targets for female representation in the profession and application process. 
	 4) Transparency
		 - Transparency is a key component of accountability and this is fostered through external scrutiny of both published annual reports and surveys (including the 2015 and 2020 survey of DBSH amongst fellows and trainees) or a review of the selection process for members of the training board.
	 5) Selection of Training Consultants
		 - Training consultants have to undergo the *Foundation Skills for Surgical Educators* course which advises on how to best educate, give feedback and deal with issues
	 6) Complaints Management
		 -  Normalise constructive feedback and speaking up as cornerstones of continuous improvement, to help build a culture of respect
		 - RACS has revised the code of conduct and sanctions policy to incorporate clear expectations about the management of DBSH, including clear consequences
	 7) Better Communication Standards
	 8)  Working with Partners
