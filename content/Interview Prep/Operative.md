### Laparoscopic Appendicectomy
- In an appropriately selected and consented patient, I would ensure by reviewing the patient preoperatively.
	- This includes examining the patient to exclude progression to peritonism, any visible scars which may alter my entry and to ensure they have emptied their bladder.
	- I would partake in the WHO TTO, ensuring an antibiotic and VTE prophylaxis plan, presence of equipment and addressing any concerns.
- Intraoperatively
	- I would ensure the patient is appropriately positioned, this is supine, left arm in, right arm out and appropriately strapped to the bed or on a pink mat
	- I would confirm my assistant is present and the patient's hair is clipped to allow exposure of the abdomen, a bair hugger is placed and my is consultant notified that I am about to start
	- I would perform a surgical scrub, glove and gown and prep the patient from the xiphisternum to pubis with alcoholic chlorhex, draping once dry
	- I would begin on the right side of the patient, and perform a modified hasson entry
		- Retracting the umbilicus with a moynihan forceps, I would perform an Infraumbilical, vertical, midline incision 3-4 cm, blunt dissection down to fascia and exposing the cicatrix with s-retractors. I would make a sharp incisoin into the umbilicus, and enter the abdomen with an artery forceps.
		- I would insert a 10mm laparoscopic port, on low flow insufflation and insert my white balanced lap camera.
		- I would confirm im intraabdonminal and switch to high-flow with pressure of 12mmHg.
	- I would position the patient in trendelenburg, right side up and place my working ports under vision in the L)IF and suprapubic region, ensuring triangulation.
		- Concerns at this time would be injury to the inferior epigastric vessels or bladder. I would mitigate this risk by careful identification of the anatomy
	- I begin by confirming the diagnosis, inspect and washing out the pelvis. If necessary I would walk the bowel to exclude a Meckel's diverticulum, colonic diverticulitis and Crohn's disease.
	- I would then isolate the appendix with laparoscopic debakeys, sweeping the omentum and small bowel away and bringing the free edge of the mesoappendix into my vision under tension.
	- I would divide the mesoappendix with a hook diathermy to isolate the appendiceal artery and gain proximal and distal control with diathermy attached to either a hook or marylands sharp diathermy distal to my control.
	- I would then dissect the mesoappendix off the appendix until I reached the base, inspect and secure the base with 2x 0' loop PDS and divide between. I would inspect for haemostasis and perform a focused wash to decrease contamination, sucking out any residual fluid in the pelvis.
	- I would then retrieve the appendix via an endocatch through the umbililca port, switching my scope to a 5mm in the R)IF. 
	- I would remove the ports under vision, ensuring no damage to surrounding structures, remove the pneumoperitoneum and close the fascia with a figure-8 using a PDS/Vicryl
	- I would infiltrate LA into the skin, and close with a 3'0 monocryl, opsite.
- Post-operatively
	- I would ensure I have documented my findings, a post-operative plan including diet, analgesia, VTE prophylaxis and follow-up for histology. 
	- I would review the patient in recovery and notify them of the findings. 

### Diathermy
 - Electricity recap
	 - Voltage: Measure of specific potential energy (potential energy per unit charge) between two locations
	 - Current: The rate at which electrons flow past a point in a complete electrical circuit_
	    ![[Voltage.png]]
	 - Impedance: The measure of the opposition that a current will come up against when trying to complete a circuit through tissue (i.e. a measure of resistance)
	 - Capacitance: The ability of a body to store electrical charge (e.g. a water tank )
	    ![[Capacitor.png]]
	 - Ohm's Law: Voltage = Current x Resistance
	    ![[Ohms Law.png]]
 - Diathermy is the use of an electrical, high frequency alternate current (HFAC) to cut or coagulate tissue during surgery. It allows for precise incisions to be made with limited blood loss. Diathermy machines consist of monopolar, bipolar and ultrasound devices each with specific risks and benefits;
 - Monopolar
	 - Mechanism of action:
		 - Emittance of HFAC from an active electrode through the patients tissue to a return electrode pad placed on the patient. This produces heat within body tissues causing protein denaturation and coaptation.
			 - Diathermy uses frequencies above >500KHz, whereas neuromuscular stimulation ceases a 100KHz and so isn't stimulated
			 -  As the current passes through the body, the current density decreases rapidly as the surface area the current acts across increases. Consequently, this allows for focused heating of tissues at the point of use, without heating up the body systemically.
		 - Fulguration:
			 - Results from the action of electrical arcs striking the tissue at divergent locations. This results in superficial tissue destruction around 60$^o$C with large amounts of carbonization Useful in malignant tumours, often using a needle-like probe
		- Coagulation:
			- Higher voltage, interrupted frequency waveform which produces less heat (60$^o$C - 90$^o$C) with the heading and cooling of tissues causing dehydration and forming a coagulum (protein-rich mixture) that allows sealing of smaller blood vessels and control of local bleeding
		- Cutting:
			- Lower voltage continuous sine wave which produces intense heat around 100$^o$C which vaporises tissues producing minimal coagulation and haemostasis
	    ![[Diathermy cutcoag.png]]
	    ![[Monopolar functions.png]] 
	 - Benefit:
		 - Allows for limited blood loss and easier coagulation
	 - Risk:
		 - Direct thermal Injury (inadvertent injury or )
			 - Mitigated: Good contact between the patient and the ground plate (i.e. clip hair and ensure adequate connection) avoiding bony prominences, metal prosthesis, not distal to tourniquets, not over scar tissue and kept dry. Machines monitor impedance to ensure this.
		 - Indirect Thermal Injury (insulation failure)
			 - Insulation Failure
				 - Failure of insulation which often goes unrecognised
			 - Coupling Injuries refers to the discharge of ions between 2 conductive surfaces causing inadvertent injury
				 - Direct Coupling: transmission of an active electrode with another conductive by direct contact (e.g. buzz my forceps)
			 - Capacitive Coupling: the induction of stray current to a surrounding conductor through the intact insulation of an active electrode
					Mitigate: Ensure trocars and in contact with the abdominal wall (resistor) to dissipate the energy
		- Plume inhalation
			- Contains chemical by-products (acrylonitrile and hydrogen cyanide) which can be absorbed by the skin and lungs. Also contains carbonized blood products and viral DNA/bacteria.
			- Mitigate: Smoke evacuators, high-filtration masks
		- ICD interference
			- Deactivate these prior and consider placing defib pads on intraoperatively
- Bipolar
	 - Mechanism of action: 
		 - Emittance of HFAC from an active electrode through the patients tissue to a second return electrode, not requiring a return pad
	 - Benefit:
		 - Uses a lower voltage with a limited circuit size
		 - Less thermal spread (<5mm)
	 - Risk:
		 - Less effective on larger blood vessels
	 - Instruments
		 - Ligasure
			 - Bipolar device with an associated cutting blade
			 - Seals vessels <7mm
- Ultrasonic
	 - Mechanism of action: 
		 - Ultrasonic instruments (eg: Harmonic®) propagate mechanical sound waves (vibrations) which cause rapid temperature increases resulting in protein denaturation and coaptation
	 - Benefit:
		 - Lower temperatures 80$^o$C
	 - Risk:
		 - Device physically heats up (can lead to inadvertant injury)
	 - Instruments
		 - Thunderbeat
			 - Combines Bipolar and ultrasonic technology
			 - Seals and cuts vessels up to 7mm
