 - [0] The WHO surgical safety checklist is a perioperative checklist which occurs before and after an operation to reduce patient adverse events and improve communication around surgery. It has three main components (Sign in, Time Out and Sign Out). 
 - Sign In %% fold %% 
	 - Occurs prior to anaesthetic being administered (typically in the anaesthetic bay with the anaesthetist, scrub nurse and surgeon)
	 1. Confirm patient identity (name, URN, DOB and consent) and surgery 
	 2. Confirm site of procedure is marked
	 3. Assess allergies
	 4. Assess alerts
	 5. VTE prophylaxis plan
	 6. Abx prophylaxis plan
	 7. Risk of >500mls blood loss (or >7ml/kg in children)
	 8. Prosthesis available and checked
	 9. Essential imaging checked (patient identity, indication and available in theatre)
	 10. Anaesthetic safety checklist completed
	 11. Difficult airway equipment available
	 12. Stop before you block(())
 - Time Out %% fold %%
	 - Occurs prior to the surgery commencing (typically in the operating theatre with the anaesthetist, scrub nurse and surgeon)
	 13. Confirm all members of the team know each other
	 14. Confirm the patient identity, procedure and site
	 15. Confirm antibiotics have been administered
	 16. Pressure injury prophylaxis
	 17. Anticipated critical events (surgical, anaesthetic and nursing)
 - Sign Out %% fold %%
	 - Occurs before the patient leaves the operating room
	 18. Confirm the procedure name and the surgical count is correct
	 19. Confirm the specimen is labelled and request forms completed
	 20. Report any equipment issues
	 21. Confirm post-operative plan (pressure injury prevention)

### ASA Score %% fold %%
  - The American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) score is a subjective, physical status classification from I - VI of a patient's overall pre-operative health which correlates to the risk of post-operative complications. On its own, the ASA classification of physical status is not a predictor of operative risk (which is defined by the patients pre-operative health, the physical derangement of the procedure skill skill of the surgeon and anaesthetist and their perioperative support) %% fold %% 
	 - Elective surgery (ASA score I = 0.41/1,000; scores IV and V = 9.6/1,000) 
	 - Emergency surgeries (ASA I = 1/1,000 increases to 26.5/1,000 in classes IV and V ^[Tiret L, Hatton F, Desmonts JM, Vourc’h G. Prediction of outcome of anaesthesia in patients over 40 years: A multifactorial risk index. Stat Med. 1988;7:947–54. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3175394/]
	 - An 'E' is added after the score to indicate an emergency operation
	 - Electively, all <span style="color:#00b050">ASA 3+ patients</span> should have a consultant pre-anaesthetic review to quantify risk factors, optimize medical concerns, refer to specialists if required and plan for ICU/HDU needs

		 - [ ] Other local indications vary but may include;
			 - >50% of blood volume lost within 3 hours
			 - Total blood volume replaced over 24 hours
	- [ ]  To activate an MTP, the lead clinician must;
		- [ ] Notify the path labs and blood bank to identify a time frame for delivery and notify if using a ROTEM/TEG based resuscitation
		- [ ] Contact a haematologist $\pm$ retrievals
		- [ ] Administration of adjuncts including TXA 1g IV over 10 minutes

- Transfusion Reactions %% fold %%  ^44679b
	- [0] Blood transfusion is a potentially life-threatening medical emergency and I would ensure I have promptly reviewed the patient. My approach to blood transfusion reactions is dependent on if they are acute (within 24 hours), or delayed (>24 hours) and immune or non-immune mediated. In the first instance I would stop the transfusion immediately and assess the patient in accordance with the CCrISP protocol of ABCDE. I would check and monitor the patient's vital signs and establish new IV access, ensuring the old line is not flushed. I would repeat all clerical and identity checks to ensure the right pack has been given to the right patient and notify the blood bank and service provider.
	- Acute Immune
		- <span style="color:#ff0000">Allergic Reaction</span>

			- Reporting of a [[Clinical Error and Governance#^413f29|sentinel event]]
		- <span style="color:#ff0000">Febrile Non-Haemolytic Transfusion</span>
			- Incidence
				- About 0.1 - 1% of transfusions
				- Can be prevented by leukoreduction (removal of WBC from donor blood) which occurs in Australia
			- Pathophysiology
				- Type II hypersensitivity reaction driven by recipient antibodies against HLA-antigens on the donors WBC, which causes  the release of inflammatory mediators (e.g. cytokines) from WBC in donor blood
				- More common in children
			- Symptoms
				- Being within 1-6 hours of transfusion
				- **Fever**, chills, headache and flushing
			- Management
				- Stop the transfusion
				- Exclude serious adverse events
				- Symptomatic management (Antipyretics)
				- Recommence transfusion is the reaction subside
		- <span style="color:#ff0000">TRALI</span>
			- Incidence
				- 1 in 1,200 - 190,000 incidence
				- Primary cause of transfusion related deaths
			- Pathophysiology
				- Two-hit hypothesis
					1) Sequestration of priming of neutrophils in the pulmonary capillaries due to trauma, sepsis or shock
					2) Antibodies in the donor blood activate the primer neutrophils which release cytokines, proteases and oxidases. This leads to increased pulmonary capillary permeability, causing fluid accumulation in the lung interstitium resulting in non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema
			- Symptoms
				- Begin within minutes to 6 hours of transfusion
				- SpO2 < 90% on RA or PaO2/FiO2 < 300
				- Dyspnoea, tachypnoea, bilateral CXR infiltrates and no evidence of fluid overload
				- Fever, hypotension
			- Investigation
				- CXR
				- HLA-HNA antibody and typing
			- Management
				- Stop the transfusion
				- Ventilatory assistance for ARDS
				- Notify lab and Lifeblood
	- Acute Non-Immune

		- <span style="color:#ff0000">Bacterial Sepsis</span>
			- Incidence
				- PRBC risk is [1:2,500,000](https://transfusion.com.au/adverse_transfusion_reactions/sepsis), but this is ten times higher with platelets (1:250,000), which are not refrigerated
			- Pathophysiology
				- The source of bacteria is generally the donor’s skin but can also be due to an underlying asymptomatic bacterial infection in the donor
			- Symptoms
				- Rigors, fevers, chills, hypotension, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, dyspnoea, circulatory collapse
				- Renal failure or DIC
			- Investigations
				- Blood cultures from the patient and donor blood
			- Management
				- Stop the transfusion immediately
				- Commence broad-spectrum antibiotics
				- Supportive therapy for sepsis
				- Advise Transfusion Service Provider to notify Lifeblood to ensure quarantine and testing of related components from the same donation/donor.
		- <span style="color:#ff0000">TACO</span>
			- Incidence
				- 1%
			- Pathophysiology
				- Increased volume into vasoconstricted venous circulation increases preload and stressors a weakened left ventricle to decompensate and cause cardiogenic respiratory failure
			- Risk factors;
				- LV dysfunction, existing respiratory disease
				- Low BMI, 
				- Chronic anaemia
				- Renal Failure
			- Symptoms
				- Begins within 6 hours
				- Respiratory distress and pulmonary oedema
				- Hypertension, tachycardia and fluid overload signs
			- Management
				- Stop the transfusion
				- Oxygen supplementation
				- Ventilation with a higher PEEP
				- Consider a venodilator to decrease preload (e.g. GTN)
				- Diuretics
	- Delayed Immune
		- <span style="color:#ff0000">Delayed Haemolytic reaction</span>
			- Incidence
				- 1 in 2,500 - 11,000
			- Pathophysiology
				- An <span style="color:#00b050">anamnestic immune response</span> to the presence of recipient antibodies against minor antigens on the donor blood (e.g. Rhesus Factor). The antibody is present in very low titres which may not cause agglutination in a group-and-hold specimen
					- Anamnestic means that the recipient requires prior exposure to the antigen
				- The antibodies don't directly cause intravascular haemolysis, but rather mark the donor blood which is removed by the reticuloendothelial system as extravascular haemolysis
			- Onset
				- After 24 hours, but typically within 1-2 weeks
			- Symptoms
				- Asymptomatic
				- Mild fever, jaundice
			- Management
		- <span style="color:#ff0000">Transfusion-associated GVHD</span>
			- Pathophysiology
				- Engraftment and proliferation of transfused donor T-lymphocytes which then destroy the recipient cells carrying HLA antigens.
			- Incidence
				- Rare incidence, occurring between the 4th and 40th day
			- Symptoms
				- Universally fatal
				- Widespread rash, desquamation, GI mucositis, hepatitis
		- <span style="color:#ff0000">Post-transfusion Purpura</span>
			- Pathophysiology
				- PTP is a sudden onset of thrombocytopenia 5-10 days following a blood or platelet transfusion
				- The mechanism seems to be an autoantibody-mediated destruction of both the transfused platelets and the patient's own.
			- Incidence
				- More common in women (90% of cases) and those who have been pregnant
			- Symptoms
			- Management
				- High dose IV immunoglobulin therapy, 2g/kg in divided doses over 2-5 consecutive days. Plasmapheresis is also an option.
		- Alloimmunisation, immune modulation
			- 1% Alloimmunisation to RBC antigens
			- 10% alloimmunisation to HLA antigens
