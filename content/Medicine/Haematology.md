### Haemostasis
 - Haemostasis is the balance between bleeding and clotting and involves;
	 - Blood vessels
		 - Vasoconstriction by subendothelial fibroblasts reduces bleeding
		 - Smooth endothelial cell lining prevents spontaneous initiation of coagulation
	 - Platelets
		 - Derived from megakaryocytes and cause adhesion and aggregation
		 - Platelets adhere to collagen via Von Willibrand Factor (vWF)
	- Coagulation Factors
		- Coagulation factors (proteins) are procoagulants which drive the generation of thrombin and fibrin
		- Natural inhibitors (anticoagulants)
	- Fibrinolytic system
		- Fibrinolytic proteins, enzymes and inhibitors undergo fibrinolysis (the proteolytic digestion of fibrinogen to fibrin by the enzyme plasmin), which is activated by thrombin
		- Platelet derived growth factor released to promote vascular healing
		- Produces degradation products like D-Dimer
		- Anticoagulation system involves Protein C/S and anti-thrombin
- Haemostasis is divided into primary and secondary haemostasis which occur simultaneously
	- ![[Primary vs Secondary Haemostasis.png]]
 - Primary Haemostasis
	 - Occurs due to endothelial damage which exposes <span style="color:#00b050">subendothelial collagen</span> and <span style="color:#00b050">releases tissue factors</span> to allow platelets to adhere to the site of injury.
		 - Platelets adhere to collagen via adhesive proteins including Von Willebrand Factor (VWF)
	 - Platelet aggregation causes formation of a<span style="color:#00b050"> platelet plug</span> which release coagulation compounds and form a <span style="color:#00b050">phospholipid surface </span>for secondary haemostasis to occur
	 ![[Primary Haemostasis.png]]
	
 - Secondary Haemostasis
	 - <span style="color:#00b050">Tissue factor</span> released from epithelial cells activates <span style="color:#00b050">coagulation cascade</span> which cause conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin
	 - The purpose of the factors in the coagulation cascade is to produce cross-linked fibrin polymers and is activated via the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway. It has three overlapping phases;
		 - Initiation
			 - Exposure of TF (from endothelial cells, monocytes or neutrophils) combined with Factor VII to form a complex triggers blood coagulation
		 - Amplification
			 - Due to the generation of fibrin via the multiple positive feedback loops of thrombin on activating factors V, VIII and XI
		 - Propagation
			 - Expansion and stabilisation of platelet/fibrin plug due to the activation of Factor XIII by thrombin (which cross-links fibrin monomers to form a stable polymer)
	- Coagulation factors are<span style="color:#00b050"> serine proteases</span> (enzymes that cleave peptide bonds in protein) but circulate as inactive co-factors or zymogens ^153f15
		- Factors are activated by an enzyme <span style="color:#00b050">in the presence of Ca2+ phospholipids</span>
		- All factors (except factor VIII are synthesised in the liver)
		- Factors II, VII, IX and X are Vit K dependent (they are still produced but can’t bind Ca2+ in the absence of Vit K which prevents their action in enzyme-substrate complexes)

- Fibrinolysis
	 - Inhibition of the plasminogen activators (t-PA or u-PA) by PAI-1 or PAI-2
		 - Plasminogen is a circulating zymogen, which is present in blood around 2 μmol/L
		 - Plasminogen is converted into the active enzymatic form Plasmin by either tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) or Urokinase type plasminogen activator (u-PA)
	 - Inhibition of plasmin by antiplasmin (present in blood around 1 μmol/L
		 - Plasmin activation occurs on the clot surface due to exposed Lysine residues, which provide binding sites for the protease (t-PA) and substrate (plasminogen) to colocalise on the surface and allow activation of plasminogen to plasmin
		 - Plasmin has a circulating half-life of less than 10 milliseconds
	 - Inhibition of binding of plasminogen and plasminogen activators to the exposed lysine residues, either by TAFI or using lysine analogues (such as TXA)
		 - <span style="color:#00b050">TAFI</span> a carboxypeptidase which can cleave C-terminal Lysine  and arginine residues from fibrin, which prevents t-PA or plasminogen from assembling on the fibrin surface, to block fibrinogen
		 - <span style="color:#00b0f0">Tranexamic acid</span> (TXA) is a <span style="color:#00b050">Lysine analogue</span> which competitively inhibits plasminogen and t-PA binding to fibrin, thus preventing fibrinolysis
			 - TXA dose is 15-15mg/kg PO or IV q8hr for up to 7 days. Requires an adjusted dose in renal impairment.
			 - Contraindicated in DIC and renal tract bleeding (as retained clots may cause renal impairment)

### Immunology
 - Hypersensitivity Reactions ^e03fd9
	 - Type I ^453d6f
		 - IgE mediated mast cell activation against a soluble antigen
	 - Type II
		 - 
	 - Type III
	 - Type IV

### Blood Tests
 - Coagulation Tests
 - Haptoglobin ^f370ac
	 - Haptoglobin is a protein made in the liver that binds free haemoglobin, resulting in the removal of the complex from the circulation.
	 - Therefore low haptoglobin levels suggest high circulating haemaoglobin levels (i.e. haemolysis)

### MDS
 - G-CSF
