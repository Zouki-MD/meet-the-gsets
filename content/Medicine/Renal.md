## Antidiuretic Hormone
 - When plasma osmolality drops we need to excrete more urine to reconcentrate (i.e. diuresis), so anti-diuresis hormones are reduced. This reduced expression of aquaporins which allows urine to leave.
 - Suppose the feedback loop is broken (i.e. SIADH) and ADH is released despite low plasma concentrations, then plasma volume increases which triggers release of aldosterone due to high intravascular pressures (Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system). Less Aldosterone causes the body to excrete sodium (or more specifically reduce sodium uptake), which causes the concentration gradient to change and water is excreted to normalise fluid status (at the price of Na+)
