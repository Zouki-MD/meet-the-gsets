## **Relevant Anatomy** 
 - Appendiceal Artery
 - Appendiceal Base
## **Indication:** 
 - Acute appendicitis
 - Appendiceal malignancy

## **Pre-operative steps:**
 - Confirm the diagnosis
 - Consent the patient
	 - Specific risks include damage to bladder, bowel, bleeding from the inferior epigastric vessels, leak from the appendiceal stump
- Perform a sign in
	- Ensure the patient has recently urinated


## **Operative steps:**
- WHO TTO
	- Prescribe cefazolin and metronidazole
- Position the patient
	- Reassess whilst the patient is anaesthetised
	- Supine with the left arm in (tucked with a pillow) and right arm out
- Scrub, prep and drape
	- Prep from xiphisternum to pubis with Chlorhexadine (red)
	- Place drapes low on the patient's left and below the pubic bone to prevent getting in the way of the port placement
- Infra-umbilical [[Hasson entry]]
	- Camera: 30o telescope
	- Port size: 10mm in adults, 5mm in paediatric patients
	- Gas pressure: 12mmHg in adults
- Reposition the patient
	- Head down and roll to the left
- Place ports under vision
	- Insert LA in TAP plane
	- Ports are lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels and above the bladder
- Inspect and washout the pelvis
	- Exclude an ovarian cyst, ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, cholecystitis, perforated peptic ulcer. If necessary walk the bowel to exclude a Meckel's diverticulum, colonic diverticulitis and Crohn's disease.
- Isolate the appendix
	- Sweep the omentum and small bowel away with the right hand. Locate the appendix and blunt dissection until you can clearly identify the tinea coli and appendiceal base. 
	- Locate the free edge of the meso-appendix and have good counter traction on the left hand
	- Risk: Perforation of viscous and mis-identification of anatomy
	- Mitigate: Clearly identify the anatomy
-   Diathermy the mesoappendix to skeletonise it and try to identify the appendiceal artery
	- Risk: Injury to the appendiceal artery leading to poor vision
	- Mitigate: Slowly dissecting with the diathermy in small segments until you have created a sufficient window. Counter traction with left hand grasper.

·       Mitigate: Can control bleeding with Maryland forceps and then attach diathermy once satisfied. Ensure the entire metal is visualised to prevent inadvertent injury

-   Skeletonize the appendix to the base and endoloop x3

·       Risk: Leaving appendiceal base behind or not controlled the loops such that they slide

·       Mitigate: Correctly identify the anatomy

-   Cut the appendix and the endo-loops. Suction with left hand to the appendiceal base to prevent faeculant contamination. Examine the pelvis and irrigate down along the bladder.

-   Switch camera to 5mm port, place appendix in endocatch and remove ports under vision

-   Close the umbilical port with 0’ maxon and skin with 4’0 monocryl

·       Risk: Not closing the fascia correctly may result in post-operative umbilical hernia

·       Mitigate: Digitate the wound to ensure no gaps are remaining. Secure you stitch when performing a hand tie

·       Risk: Catching some small bowel when closing the anterior abdominal wall

·       Mitigate: Correctly identify the anatomy, bring the tissue up towards you

 ## Operative note;
- Consultant: Name
-  Surgeon: Name
-  Assistant: Name
-  Findings: Uncomplicated acute appendicitis with some free fluid in peritoneum. No perforation, nil contamination.
-  GA, Timeout, IV Abx, Prep + drape, Infraumbilical Hassan port entry, 2x 5mm ports placed under vision. Mesoappendix divided with diathermy, appendiceal artery controlled with bipolar, appendix skeletonised to base, 3x endoloops placed to base, appendix cut and retrieved with endocatch, RIF and pelvis irrigated, ports removed under direct vision. Fascia closed with 0’ maxon and skin closed with 4’0 monocryl. Dressed with steristrips and opsite
-  Post-op comments: RPOA, E+D and mobilise, cease Abx, likely discharge this PM, ASU CNC to follow-up 3/52, histopath review
