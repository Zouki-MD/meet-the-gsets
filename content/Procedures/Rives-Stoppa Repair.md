### Indication
### Operation
- The compartment is accessed through an incision in the posterior rectus sheath approximately 1 cm from the medial edge of the rectus muscle. 
- This space must be dissected laterally on both sides of the linea alba to a distance of 8 to 10 cm beyond the defect. 
- Both leaflets of the posterior sheath are then sutured together to create an extraperitoneal pocket in which to place the prosthetic material. 
- The prosthetic mesh extends 5 to 6 cm beyond the <span style="color:#00b050">superior and inferior</span> borders of the defect. 
- The use of transfascial sutures to secure the mesh remains controversial, and no definitive evidence exists supporting either approach. The authors selectively use transfascial sutures. ^[Sabistons 20th Ed, Chapter 17]
	- With smaller defects, the mesh does not need to be sutured because it is held in place by intra-abdominal pressure ([[Hernias#^75aca5|Pascalâ€™s principle]]), allowing eventual incorporation into the surrounding tissues. 
	- Alternatively, in larger defects, the mesh can be secured laterally with several sutures. This approach avoids contact between the mesh and abdominal viscera and has been shown in long-term studies to have a respectable recurrence rate (14%) in large incisional hernias.
