### Barrett's Oesophagus (BO)
- Histology
	- Squamocolumnar junction with **<span style="font-weight:bold; color:#00b050">goblet cell intestinal metaplasia</span>** consistent with Barrett's Oesophagus
		![[UGI. Barretts Histology.png]]
- Endoscopic Assessment
	- The Prague Classification is a tool for describing the severity of Barrett's oesophagus based on endoscopic findings
		- The classification is based on two measurements (C<sub>n</sub>M<sub>n</sub>):
			- **M**: The maximal length of BO (including any tongues)
			- **C**: The length in centimetres that the BO circumferentially extends around the oesophagus

- Endoscopic Surveillance
	- Seattle Protocol guideline for screening and surveillance of Barrett's Oesophagus
		- The Seattle protocol, first described in 1993^[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8514061/| Seattle Protocol], consists of careful visual inspection of the Barrett’s segment with a systematic biopsy approach. The Seattle protocol has an increased detection of dysplasia compared to a non-systematic approach ^[https://journals.lww.com/ajg/abstract/2008/04000/systematic_four_quadrant_biopsy_detects_barrett_s.7.aspx];
			- Biopsies of any <span style="color:#00b050">endoscopically visible lesions</span> AND,
			- <span style="color:#00b050">4 quadrant biopsies at 1-2 cm intervals</span> starting within 2 cm of the level of the LOS to the squamocolumnar junction (z line)
				- LOS is identified by the rugal folds of the stomach
				- 1 cm interval if known or suspected **<span style="font-weight:bold; color:#00b050">dysplasia</span>**  
				- 2 cm interval if no known or suspected dysplasia

		- Australian clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of Barrett’s oesophagus and early oesophageal adenocarcinoma (2015) ^[https://www.cancer.org.au/assets/pdf/9-august-2020| Cancer Care Guidelines] recommended screening endoscopy schedules.
			- <span style="color:#ff0000">No dysplasia</span>
				- Short (< 3 cm) segment: repeat endoscopy in 3–5 years
				- Long (≥ 3 cm) segment: repeat endoscopy in 2–3 years
			- <span style="color:#ff0000">Indefinite for dysplasia</span>
				- Review by second pathologist
				- Repeat endoscopy in 6 months as per Seattle Protocol with 1 cm biopsies
			- <span style="color:#ff0000">Low Grade Dysplasia</span>
				- Repeat endoscopy every 6 months as per Seattle Protocol with 1 cm biopsies
				- If 2 consecutive 6-monthly endoscopies with Seattle Protocol show no dysplasia, then consider reverting to a less frequent follow up schedule.
			- <span style="color:#ff0000">High Grade Dysplasia</span>
				- Managed as malignancy
