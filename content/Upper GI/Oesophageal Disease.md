## The Oesophagus
### Gross Anatomy
 -  The oesophagus begins at the lower border of the cricoid (<span style="color:#00b050">criocopharyngeus</span>) and ends at the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ).
 - It is about 25 cm and runs through the mediastinum at T10, left of the midline and can divided into three components
	 - Cervical (from cricopharyngeus to the thoracic inlet)
	 - Thoracic (thoracic inlet to )
	 - Abdominal

## Benign Oesophageal Lesions
 - [[Oesophageal Disease#^808572|Squamous Cell Papilloma]]
 - Oesophageal Adenoma
	 - Develop from the submucosal oesophageal glands and are exceedingly rare
- Developmental Cysts
- Congenital Duplications
- Fibrovascular polyps
### Squamous Cell Papilloma
^808572
- Most frequent benign epithelial tumours of the oesophagus, most commonly located in the <span style="color:#00b050">middle or lower third</span> of the oesophagus
- Clinical Presentation
	- Typically asymptomatic and found on investigation
	- Can rarely result in dysphasia and heartburn
- Aetiology
	- Alcohol consumption, 
	- Smoking 
	- Reflux esophagitis,
	- Metal stent or chronic food impaction)
	- Infection (HPV infection)
	- Genetic syndromes (Goltz-Gorlin syndrome and angioma serpiginosum)
- Differential Diagnosis
	- Verrucous Carcinoma
	- Squamous Cell Carcinoma
	- Glycogenic acanthosis
- Pathophysiology
	- Papillary proliferation of non-dysplastic squamous epithelium with fibrovascular cores of lamina propria
		- [[HPV#^09dbae|Koilocytes]] can be seen
- Investigations
	- Endoscopy
		- Distinctive exophytic appearance (well demarcated lesion that is sessile or partly pedunculated and usually less than 5mm in diameter)
		![[Oesophageal Papilloma.png]]
- Management
	- Endoscopic resection / polypectomy
	- Radiofrequency ablation
	- Cryotherapy

## Oesophageal Malignancy

Oesophageal malignancies can be broadly differentiated according to cells of origin:
- <span style="color:#00b050">Epithelial malignancies</span> (more common)
	- Squamous cell cancer
	- Adenocarcinoma (Barrett's and non-Barrett's associated)
- <span style="color:#00b050">Mesenchymal malignancies</span>
	- Leiomyoma
	- Granular cell tumours

	- Symptoms



### Oesophageal SCC
- Epidemiology
	- Affects males (2-10 times) more than females
	- Average age between 50 - 60 years old at diagnosis
- Assessment and History
	- Risk Factors
		- Modifiable
			- Tobacco smoking
			- Alcohol and hot beverage intake
			- Diet (lack of fresh fruit and high bbq meats and pickled vegetables)
			- Corrosive substance ingestion
			- Ionizing radiation
			- HPV
		- Non-modifiable
			- Achalasia
			- Zenker's diverticulum
			- Coeliac disease
			- Plummer-Vinson syndrome (Paterson-Kelly syndrome)
			- Tylosis (focal non-epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma)

- Investigations
- Classification
	- GOJ malignancy (Siewert Classification)
		- **Type I**: Lesion located <span style="color:#00b050">1-5 cm above the GOJ</span> (managed as oesophageal cancer)
		- **Type II**: Lesion centered at the GOJ, <span style="color:#00b050">1 cm above or 2 cm below the junction</span> (managed as oesophageal cancer).
		- **Type III**: Lesion located <span style="color:#00b050">2-5 cm below the GOJ</span> (managed as gastric cancer)
- Staging
- Management
	- Neoadjuvant treatment (chemoradiotherapy vs )
		-  Typical neoadjuvant treatment regimens for oesophageal cancer often include combinations of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Here are some commonly used regimens:

1. **CROSS Regimen**: This includes **chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel**, followed by **radiation therapy**. It's widely used in Europe and has shown good results in clinical trials1.
    
2. **FLOT Regimen**: This regimen involves **fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel**. It's another standard option, especially in some Western countries1.
    
3. **Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Alone**: In some regions, particularly parts of Asia, neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (without radiation) is used. Drugs like cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil may be used in these cases.

- Relevant anatomy
	- Embryology
	- 
- Pathophysiology
	- Histology
		- Classified as having tubular, papillary, mucinous and signet ring cell patterns
		- Tubular pattern is the most common morphological type and shows tubules lined with a single layer or stratified malignant cells

### Krukenberg Tumour 

 - A metastatic malignancy to the ovary which is characterized by a<span style="color:#00b050"> mucin-rich signet-ring adenocarcinoma </span>that primarily arises from a gastrointestinal tract ^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482284/ | Aziz M, Killeen RB, Kasi A. Krukenberg Tumor. [Updated 2023 Feb 21]. In: StatPearls [Internet]. Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing; 2024 Jan-.]
	 - Note: It is thought to spread to the ovary because they are not lined by peritoneum
 - Spreads via;
	 - Trasncoelomic spread
	 - Lymphatic spread
	 - Haematogenous spread
